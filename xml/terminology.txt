xml spec refers to the XML 1.0 specification document available at https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/.
Specifically this code is written to the February 2013 version of the document (most recent).

When validating character sequences I write xmlspec::Blah to refer to the Blah grammar specification in the xml spec,
written in Extended Backus-Naur Form. These have been translated to regular expressions and can be found in the
RegularExpressions.py file.
E.g. xmlspec::Name refers to the Name symbol from section 2.3 defined as:
Name ::== NameStartChar (NameChar)*
